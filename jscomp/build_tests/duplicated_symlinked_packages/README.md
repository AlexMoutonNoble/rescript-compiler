Special tests for duplicated symlink warnings

Run `node ./jscomp/build_tests/duplicated_symlinked_packages/input.js` to check the tests against previous snapshots.
Run `node ./jscomp/build_tests/duplicated_symlinked_packages/input.js update` to update the snapshots (assuming you've made some changes to duplicated)
